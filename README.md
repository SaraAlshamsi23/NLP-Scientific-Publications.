# NLP-Scientific-Publications

## Project Description

Welcome to the NLP-Scientific-Publications project! This project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable insights and trends from a diverse range of scientific publications. The primary goals include:

- Identifying prevalent research themes and topics across various domains.
- Analyzing the evolution of research focus over time.
- Enhancing the efficiency of literature reviews by automating the extraction of key information.

### Business Understanding

The project is designed to contribute to the field of data science and research by providing a valuable resource for researchers, institutions, and policymakers. As we dive into the world of NLP, we explore innovative ways to unlock the wealth of knowledge hidden within scientific literature.

## Current Focus

The current focus of the project includes:
- Exploring and preprocessing datasets of scientific publications.
- Implementing and fine-tuning NLP techniques for topic modeling and keyword extraction.
- Visualizing and interpreting the results to derive meaningful insights.
